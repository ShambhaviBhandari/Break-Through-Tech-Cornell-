    "*I used 6 one-hot encoded features that represent education levles and also includes gender the features are educaiton_Bachelors, education_Doctorate, education_masters, education_Prof-school, education_Some-college, sex_selfID_Non-Female. \n",
    "\n",
    "*I have my target value of income_binary which had numberic values of less then 50k which is 0 and 50k as 1 which helps with binary classification. My data was split into 80/20 and I used the logisctic regression model. \n",
    "\n",
    "*The model correctly predicted income class most of the time with 78.3% and with precision 60.8% the model was correct aobut income being greater then 50k.\n",
    "    *This is where I came into my first obstical that the feature sex_slefID_Non_Female is not being used properly because I wanted to see if someons gender plus their education equalivates to a certain income of either higher then 50k or less than 50k. Because my machine  learning problem is predicting the income salary of an individual based on their education level and gender. My goal is to analyze whether someones gender, along with their education level could be used to predict income, however the current model does not provide clear insights to gender-based income.\n",
    "    \n",
    "*What I will do now: Inspect my features, add or remove features, and maybe seperating my data into smaller groups and train and evaluate on seprate models for each group.\n",

    "\n",
    "*My target variable was income_binary , based on this 13,774 non-female make more then 50k, where as there are 8,541 females who make more then 50k. For making less then 50k there are 6,301 non-females and 1,100 females who make less then 50k. High income earner for females are lower. \n",

    "*The models performace for the Female Model: Accuracy: 89.89%, Precision:58.82%, Recall 5.05%\n",
    "*The models performace for the Non-Female Model: Accuracy: 72.38%, Precision: 58.10%, Recall 49.84%\n",
    "\n",
    "*This shows that the female model has higher accuracy but low recall because it missed alot of the high income female earners. Non-female model performed with better balance of precision and recall which suggests that the data may generalize better for non-female individuals. This noticable income gap and the model performace differances shows the bias and imblance in the dateset espically for females who have a higher income. Another analysis is that there could be better data collection for feature representation for higher income females. "
