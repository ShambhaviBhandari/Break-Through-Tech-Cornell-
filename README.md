Predictive Modeling of Income Levels Using U.S. Census Data

This project was completed as part of the Machine Learning Foundations course in the Break Through Tech AI Fellowship at Cornell Tech. The objective is to build a supervised machine learning model to predict whether an individual earns more than $50,000 annually based on demographic and socioeconomic attributes from the U.S. Census dataset.

The model uses features such as education level, gender, age, occupation, workclass, and weekly working hours to classify income into two categories: ≤50K and >50K. This binary classification task explores how educational attainment and gender correlate with income distribution, highlighting broader implications for fairness, diversity, and inclusion in the workforce.

By applying standard machine learning techniques—including data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation—this project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for addressing real-world social and economic questions using data-driven methods.
